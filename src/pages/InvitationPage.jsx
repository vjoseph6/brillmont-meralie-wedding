          <p>
            Our story started with a simple connection that quickly grew into
            something real and beautiful.
          </p>
          <p>
            For months, we were in a long-distance relationship, but no matter
            the distance, our love stayed strong. We shared late-night talks,
            laughter, and endless “I miss you’s” that made us realize how much
            we meant to each other.
          </p>
          <p>
            After some time, I decided to go back home, and that’s when our
            story truly began to bloom. Not long after, we received one of the
            greatest blessings — we found out we were expecting.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through every part of my pregnancy journey, he has been my biggest
            support and strength. He stood by me through all the changes, making
            sure I never felt alone. Now, as we start this new chapter together
            as husband and wife, we’re thankful for everything that brought us
            here — the distance, the growth, and the love that made us one.
