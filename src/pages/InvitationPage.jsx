            Every great love story starts with distance, and ours was no
            different.
          </p>
          <p>
            We began our journey miles apart ‚Äî two hearts connected by messages,
            late-night calls, and endless patience. Even though we were far from
            each other, love always found its way through.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through every challenge and every waiting moment, we grew stronger.
            Our distance taught us trust, faith, and the beauty of holding on.
          </p>
          <p>
            And now, after all the miles, time, and love shared between us ‚Äî we
            are finally closing the distance. üíç
          </p>
          <p>
            We‚Äôre so happy to say that we‚Äôre getting married! What once started
            as a long-distance love has now become a forever promise.
